### Setup

- make sure [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [roots](http://roots.cx) are installed
- using a mac? it's a bit more complicated... roots needs to install packages globally without sudo permissions [check this out for help](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions)
- clone this repo down and `cd` into the folder
- run `npm install`
- run `roots watch`
- ???
- profit
